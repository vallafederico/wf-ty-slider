### Ty Slider

Based on [Keen Slider](https://github.com/rcbyr/keen-slider)

### Config

##### Webflow DOM

Setup through 2 **Mandatory** Attributes.

The **WRAPPER** attribute `data-slider="wrapper"`, is a div or an element that contains all that's related to the slider instance.
The **CONTAINER** attribute `data-slider="container"` is the element that contains all the slides (and only the slides), and needs to be a child of te wrapper.

Optionally, you can define arrows and dots. All this attributes and elements should be children of the main wrapper div.

`data-slider="left"` defines the left arrow, and sends the slider to the **previous** slide.
`data-slider="right"` defines the right arrow, and sends the slider to the **next** slide.

`data-slider="dots"` defines the wrapper for the dots element. The dots should be children of this element. You can also define the `.active` class by attaching it to the first dot. Dots are generated by counting the slides, so you need to have only two, one active and on not for styling purposes, and they will be multiplied when the code runs.

##### Parameters Configuration

Added as attributes to the container element (`data-slider="container"`).
